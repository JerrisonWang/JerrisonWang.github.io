I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong. Before that, I received a BS in Statistics from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018 and an MSc in Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Duan Li and [Dr. Chin Pang Ho](https://sites.google.com/view/clint-chin-pang-ho/home). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_en_Wang_Qiuhao_out.pdf).
