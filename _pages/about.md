I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. I received a BS in Statistics from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018, an MSc in Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019, and a Ph.D. in Data Science at City University of Hong Kong. Before I joined SWUFE, I also worked as a visiting scholar at the Department of Industrial Engineering & Decision Analytics (IDEA), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Duan Li and [Dr. Chin Pang Ho](https://sites.google.com/view/clint-chin-pang-ho/home). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV-WangQiuhao.pdf).
