About me
======
I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong. Before that, I received a BS in Statistics from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018 and an MSc in Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. Duan Li and [Dr. Chin Pang Ho](https://sites.google.com/view/clint-chin-pang-ho/home). 

My research interest includes dynamic decision making, optimization algorithms, robust optimization and reinforcement learning. You can find my CV [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
